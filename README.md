# Auction Swift

## Team & Contributions
- John: Responsible for the initial setup, the majority of the styling, and the profile pages

- Ahmmed: Developed the dashboard analytics and routing, and added mock data
- All collaborated on styling and final adjustments ("tweaks as seen fit"), and each member added necessary libraries

## What It Does
Auction Swift is an auction tool for auctioneers. Users can upload pictures of items and Auction Swift automatically generates descriptions and finds comparable sales (comps) for those products. The app helps auctioneers quickly catalog items and price them accurately.

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Mock Data
Our app uses mock data for auctions, items, and comparable sales. 
Next week we'll connect it to our backend APIs.
